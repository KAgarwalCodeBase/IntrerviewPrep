`Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)`: A class should have only one reason to change.

`Open/Closed Principle (OCP)`: It states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. 

`Liskov Substitution Principle`: "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types."

`Interface Segregation Principle`: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

`Dependency Injection`: It allows a class to depend on abstractions (interfaces) instead of concrete implementations, improving flexibility, testability, and maintainability.
