### **What is Maven?**

**Apache Maven** is a build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies, building, deploying, and documenting projects by using a **Project Object Model (POM)** file.

### **Key Features of Maven**

1. **Dependency Management**  
   Maven automates the process of including external libraries (dependencies) in your project. It downloads and manages them from repositories (e.g., Maven Central).

2. **Build Automation**  
   It provides a standard way to compile, package, test, and deploy projects using predefined build lifecycles.

3. **Standardized Directory Structure**  
   Maven encourages a consistent directory layout for projects, which simplifies project navigation and reduces configuration.

4. **Central Repository**  
   Maven relies on repositories to store libraries and plugins. It can download dependencies from the **Maven Central Repository** or other custom repositories.

5. **Plugin-Based Architecture**  
   Maven uses plugins to extend functionality. For example:
   - **Compiler Plugin**: For compiling Java code.
   - **Surefire Plugin**: For running tests.
   - **Assembly Plugin**: For creating packaged distributions.

6. **Portability**  
   Maven ensures project portability across different systems and environments by providing a consistent build process.

### **Core Concepts**

1. **POM (Project Object Model)**  
   The `pom.xml` file is the heart of a Maven project. It contains metadata about the project and configuration details for the build process.

   Example `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
       <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
       <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
       <dependencies>
           <dependency>
               <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
               <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
               <version>2.7.5</version>
           </dependency>
       </dependencies>
   </project>
   ```

2. **Coordinates**  
   Maven identifies dependencies using a set of **coordinates**:
   - **Group ID**: The group or organization the artifact belongs to (e.g., `org.springframework`).
   - **Artifact ID**: The name of the library or project (e.g., `spring-boot-starter`).
   - **Version**: The specific version of the artifact (e.g., `2.7.5`).

3. **Lifecycle Phases**  
   Maven has three built-in lifecycles, each with specific phases:
   - **Default Lifecycle** (build lifecycle):
     - `validate`: Validate the project is correct.
     - `compile`: Compile the source code.
     - `test`: Run unit tests.
     - `package`: Package the code into a JAR/WAR.
     - `install`: Install the package into the local repository.
     - `deploy`: Deploy the package to a remote repository.
   - **Clean Lifecycle**: Cleans the project by removing generated files.
   - **Site Lifecycle**: Generates project documentation.

4. **Repositories**  
   Maven uses repositories to fetch and store dependencies:
   - **Local Repository**: Located on the developer's machine (`~/.m2/repository`).
   - **Central Repository**: The default online repository hosted by Maven.
   - **Remote Repositories**: Custom repositories like Nexus or JFrog Artifactory.

### **How Maven Works**

1. **Define a Project**  
   Create a `pom.xml` file with project details and dependencies.

2. **Download Dependencies**  
   Maven resolves and downloads the dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` from the central or custom repositories.

3. **Execute Build**  
   Run Maven commands (e.g., `mvn compile`, `mvn package`) to execute the corresponding lifecycle phases.

4. **Plugins and Goals**  
   Plugins add functionality to Maven. Goals are tasks that plugins can execute.
   - Example: `mvn clean` executes the `clean` goal of the Clean Lifecycle.

### **Advantages of Maven**

1. **Dependency Management**: Automatically resolves, downloads, and updates dependencies.  
2. **Standardization**: Encourages a standard directory structure and build process.  
3. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies building, testing, and deploying projects with minimal configuration.  
4. **Extensibility**: Provides a wide range of plugins for various tasks.  
5. **Portability**: Ensures consistent builds across environments.

### **Common Maven Commands**

| Command              | Description                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `mvn clean`          | Removes generated files (e.g., `target/`).          |
| `mvn compile`        | Compiles the source code.                           |
| `mvn test`           | Runs unit tests.                                    |
| `mvn package`        | Packages the compiled code into a JAR/WAR.          |
| `mvn install`        | Installs the package to the local repository.       |
| `mvn deploy`         | Deploys the package to a remote repository.         |
| `mvn dependency:tree`| Displays the dependency hierarchy.                  |

### **Maven Directory Structure**

```plaintext
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/         (Java source code)
│   │   ├── resources/    (Application resources)
│   │   └── webapp/       (Web application files, if applicable)
│   └── test/             (Test files)
│       ├── java/
│       └── resources/
├── pom.xml              (Maven configuration file)
└── target/              (Generated files and artifacts)
```
